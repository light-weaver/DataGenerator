This repository is an off-shoot of the work done for the following paper:

Bhupinder Singh Saini, Manuel Lopez-Ibanez, and Kaisa Miettinen. 2019. Automatic surrogate modelling technique selection based on features of optimization problems. In Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion (GECCO ’19). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 1765–1772. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3319619.3326890

If you use this code for a scientific publication, we would appreciate citations to that paper.

The rest of the code for this project can be found at: https://github.com/industrial-optimization-group/SurrogateAgents2/releases/tag/GECCO2019

New version of the above code with documentation coming soon.
